# Patternmon

A C++ terminal-based Pok√©mon simulator that uses as many
design patterns as possible. Usage is never egregiously
ill-advised, but there are perhaps better implementations.

* Decorator: ./pokemon
* Visitor: ./pokemon and ./moves
* PIMPL (and Bridge): ./dex
* Factory Method: ./routes
* Template Method/NVI: ./battle
